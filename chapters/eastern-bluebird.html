            <!-- Add your book content here -->
            <p>The date is March 31st and I'm reminded of how my father, every April 1st, would summon my mother to a
                window overlooking the backyard and with excitement in his voice say, "Come see the bluebird!" She would
                drop whatever she was doing and hurry to the window, as she loved bluebirds. "Where? Where is it?" she
                would ask. My Dad would look at her, and with a little grin say, "April Fool!" She would storm off in a
                huff, but she fell for it every year. </p>
            <p>On December 27 of 2008 here in Indiana it was unusually warm - 70 degrees. A flash of
                color caught my eye, and I was astounded to see several bluebirds in a small birdbath, splashing a bit
                and getting a drink. They came back another time during the brief warm spell. What a thrill!
                I rarely see bluebirds nowadays. Back in the 1970s it was common to see several families in the fall
                coming to a large shallow pan of water my parents put out in their backyard at some distance from the
                house. There would be 12 to 15 of the brilliantly-colored birds taking their evening bath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decline in bluebird numbers is due to several factors: habitat destruction, pesticide use, and nest
                predation by other birds, i.e. house sparrows, starlings and tree swallows. Favorite nesting sites used
                to be dead trees or wooden fence posts, which now are often rare. In an effort to save bluebirds from
                extinction, nesting boxes have been erected across the country, but it is a struggle to keep the
                sparrows and other birds from taking over the nesting boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                My daughter & family who live about 20 miles north of my home built a new house a few years ago in an
                area frequented by bluebirds. With high expectations, they put up bluebird houses along their back
                property line. The area behind their home had not been developed, so it was a relatively quiet
                neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                For some reason, bluebirds have not nested in those houses. One year she tired of removing sparrows'
                nests from the houses and couldn't bring herself to do away with the baby sparrows, so she gave up and
                took the houses down. There do not seem to be as many bluebirds in that area now.
            </p>
            <p>
                While traveling into Kentucky in the early fall years ago, the club that was on its way to a country
                music show, stopped at a rural motel located on a hill at some distance from the main road. Strolling
                around after we'd checked in, I spotted a bluebird house and many, many bluebirds. I was fascinated!
                There must have been several families there. This was some years before my digital camera days.
            </p>
            <p>
                How can you not love a bluebird? Henry Thoreau said the bluebird "carries the sky on its back." These
                somewhat timid birds of the thrush family are a vivid blue with white bellies and orange throat and
                breast. The female's colors are muted. The juvenile has a spotted chest and back with blue in wings and
                tail whereas the immature looks much like the adults with duller coloration. They are 6 to 8 inches long
                with a wingspan of 10-13 inches, a chunky body and short tail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their song is described differently in any source I've used. Stokes Field Guide to Birds: “...a series
                of downslurred whistles, like ‘cheer cheerful charmer’" and "the call [is] a mellow ‘turwee.’" A
                National Geographic book, Song and Garden Birds, says they also "warble three or four delicate gurgling
                notes.”

                In addition to the nesting boxes, mealy worms put out in feeding trays will attract bluebirds. Mealy
                worms can be ordered from Internet sources if you fail to find them elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The male isn't too helpful in nest building, but he will poke nesting material through the hole in a
                nesting box - grasses, pine needles - which the female weaves into the nest. The nest is lined with
                finer grass, hair or feathers. Three to seven pale blue (sometimes white) unmarked eggs incubate for 11
                to 19 days, and the young are fledglings 17 to 19 days after hatching. A pair will usually have more
                than one brood per season. Some young will be off on their own in the fall but others stay with the
                adults through the winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                If bluebirds remain in the region through the winter (some migrate to warmer climes), they will group
                and take cover in orchards, heavy thickets or in areas where they will find adequate food.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bluebirds diet is mostly insects - crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms, spiders, and the like.
                They feed by perching up high and swooping down to pounce on an insect. During the winter months small
                fruits such as dogwood, hawthorn, and pokeberries are essential when insects are not available.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bluebird is also found in Bermuda, but loss of the Bermuda cedar trees to disease and hurricanes
                plus nest predation by sparrows, starlings and "kiskadees" (all non-native) has caused them to become
                endangered there along with cardinals and catbirds.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bluebird is the official state bird of Missouri & New York; and the Mountain Bluebird is Idaho and
                Nevada's state bird.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever I see a bluebird, I whisper, "Oh, thank you, God, for this beautiful creature!”
