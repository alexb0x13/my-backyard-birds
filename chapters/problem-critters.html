        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>Yes, I know that starlings, grackles, house finches and house sparrows are God’s creatures too, but I do
                wish they would find somewhere else to raise their families and find food – somewhere other than my
                backyard! We all know the story of how a British person introduced the starling to Central Park because
                he or she was homesick for its “song.” I believe the house sparrow and house finch were imported also –
                all have thrived beyond anyone’s imagination. They take over nesting sites of other birds, gorge
                themselves at bird feeders, and generally make a nuisance of themselves.</p>

            <p>I have seen grackles eating baby wrens that were pulled out of a wren house. Whenever I see a grackle I
                curse inwardly, though they do eat a lot of insects.</p>

            <p>One trick I’ve tried that I’ve mentioned elsewhere is to sprinkle mixed birdseed or cracked corn over the
                brush pile in my yard. That keeps them busy for a while. In the past I’ve hung a big piece of suet well
                away from the feeders to try to draw them away. I remember a time when the house sparrows and house
                finches would eat only the corn and mixed birdseed. They quickly discovered it was less work to crack
                open much larger sunflower seeds. In fact I’ve seen goldfinches make a transition from Niger seed to
                sunflower seed most likely for the same reason.</p>

            <p>Fox squirrels can be fun to watch. Don’t underestimate their cunning. The only feeder that seems to have
                thwarted the squirrels is a “Squirrel Buster” I received as a gift. But you have to be careful to place
                it away from anything the squirrel can hang from (by its toes if necessary) and reach over to gorge from
                the little seed “ports.” The weight of a squirrel clinging to the outside of the feeder, will close off
                the ports. Bungee cords for dried corn on cob can be entertaining. Cardinals, woodpeckers and grackles
                also will cling to it long enough to pull off a kernel.</p>

            <p>A gallon jar squirrel feeder or similar diversion will work for a while. They pull off a kernel of corn,
                bite out the center and drop the rest.</p>

            <img src="../images/squirrel.png" alt="Problem Critters" class="bird-image-medium">

            <p>Chipmunks…if you have an invasion of chippies, I’d strongly advise buying or borrowing a proper-sized
                humane trap. Bait it with peanut butter. Relocate the critters to some far-flung place where they can
                adapt nicely and not return! One year I took away 14 chipmunks to a new woodsy home.</p>

            <p>A chipmunk will perhaps crack a peanut and eat it, but they are hoarders and inclined to stock up their
                tunneled homes. A chippie will stuff its cheek pouches until they will hold no more and then scoot into
                one of their tunnel entrances. Not only do they enjoy feeder food, they will dig around in your patio
                flower pots searching for seeds or perhaps burying some seeds. Their tunnels can undermine your patio!
            </p>

            <p>Try the innovative feeders to discourage the varmints and problem birds and if that doesn’t work, I’d
                suggest limiting the amount of seeds that you put out at one time. Birds don’t rely totally on your
                feeding them except perhaps during a hard winter.</p>

            <p>I dearly love the families of rabbits that live under my yard barn. I just don’t plant petunias in my
                patio boxes! And, oh my! I’ve learned they love morning glories.</p>

            <p>I once witnessed a bunny and squirrel playing together! You never know what you will see if you watch
                your backyard from time to time!</p>
