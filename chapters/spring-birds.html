            <img src="../images/red-tailed.png" alt="Brown Thrasher" class="bird-image-xl">

            <p>Each spring I look for three birds that arrive and either move on or nest and spend the summer in or
                around my backyard. I don't consider that it is truly spring until I've seen a towhee, a brown thrasher
                and a catbird. Interestingly, they are all of the family Mimidae. I would suggest that bird lovers not
                clean up their yards too much in the fall – let some leaves remain under bushes or along fences, and you
                will be rewarded by seeing these returning migrants and watching their antics! Also, the birds will
                benefit by finding insects, seeds, and tiny critters beneath them.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the rural electric company had all the trees cut down on both sides of my and my
                neighbor's back property line, except for a very old oak that I may have saved. (But that's another
                story!) I understand why this was done, as an electric "feeder line" runs directly over the fencerow,
                and we customers had experienced frequent power outages. Although, as some have commented, the
                devastation has "opened up" my view of the meadow and farm beyond, it has drastically changed the
                habitat of these three migratory birds. At this writing I have seen and/or heard all three in and around
                my backyard though I'm not sure they are nesting nearby.</p>

            <p>Hawks do like to perch on the three-foot stumps that were left. (I believe this is an immature red-tailed
                hawk.) Why were the stumps left so tall? Part of the problem was that some of the smaller trees – ash,
                mulberry, hickory had grown into, through and around the farm fence on the other side of my chain link
                fence.</p>

            <p>I take heart knowing that in time the fence row will restore itself!</p>
