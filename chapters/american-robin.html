        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>Most of us take the common robin for granted. When my cousin Jamie from California visited a few years
                ago, she was enthralled to see robins. I questioned this, and she said they don't have robins in
                California. I look forward to the first robin(s) in the spring. Occasionally I will see a few throughout
                the winter.</p>

            <p>The male robin has a black head and a beautiful dark reddish-orange breast. The back and wings are dark
                gray. The beak is bright yellow. The female has a dark gray head and pale reddish breast. The juveniles
                are similar to adults but breasts are heavily spotted. They are easy to spot as they hop along behind
                their parents, squawking for food and fluttering their wings.</p>

            <p>The robin's song is a bright cheery, "cheerily, cheer up, cheer up, cheerily, cheer up" or as my Dad used
                to say, "kill him, cure him, give him physic." It will also give out with a high-pitched whistle or a
                sharp "tuk." The Golden Bird Guide reports that robins sing most just before the young hatch.</p>

            <p>Years ago my mother corresponded with a friend living in Miami Florida. This friend would write her when
                the robins left there, and about two weeks later they would arrive in Massachusetts. Often when they
                appear in March, the ground is snow-covered. One spring during a snowstorm I looked out to see my big
                maple tree filled with robins! What a sight! They looked miserable perched and hunched against the
                weather. The males arrive first with the females following in a few days.</p>

            <p>It is always a joy to the heart to see the first robins in numbers. Friends will say, "I've seen a
                robin!"</p>

            <p>Robins winter here in Indiana but have a hard time of it. They stay where fruit and berries are
                available. In spring and summertime they will come to feeders for grapes, especially if the weather is
                dry. I have seen parent robins breaking grapes into pieces to feed their young.</p>

            <p>Robins hop about on grassy expanses and meadows seeking earthworms. It cocks its head as if listening or
                looking and then stabs its beak into the ground, coming up with a worm or grub. Also in its diet are
                insects, fruit and berries.</p>

            <p>Robins are early nesters, and I am always surprised to see the first young one early in the springtime.
                Its nest is a sturdy construction of twigs, grass, paper and feathers, with compacted mud lining the
                nest and a softer material on top of that. Wikipedia reports that the female robin may have mud on her
                breast from pressing the mud into the twigs. Mourning doves often take over old robins' nests, piling
                their haphazard addition of sticks precariously atop.</p>

            <p>The two to five "robin's egg blue" eggs – a lovely light blue – incubate in about two weeks and the
                babies fledge in about two weeks.</p>

            <p>While growing up in Massachusetts, Mom and I would watch the robin fledglings with their parents. It
                seemed there was always a "slow" one that had to be fed much longer than the others. The parent would
                throw an earthworm down in front of it. If the baby didn't pick it up, the adult would peck it into
                pieces. When this didn't work it would I'm sure utter a robin's sigh and feed the pieces to its
                demanding baby. We always called this runt "Cecil," from a baby robin in a Sunday newspaper cartoon.</p>

            <p>Populations seem stable or increasing throughout its range. This is a testament to their nesting
                successes, as robins are preyed upon by cats, snakes and hawks. Cowbirds will attempt to add their eggs
                to the robins' nests, but robins usually dispose of them. Pesticides also have an impact on the robins
                as they forage for earthworms in lawns that have been treated and can consume lethal amounts.</p>

            <p>Although robins may have three clutches each breeding season, only about 25 percent of those fledged
                survive to November. After that, about half of the robins alive in any year will make it to the next. A
                lucky robin may live to be 14 years old. The entire population "turns over" on average every six years.
                (Wikipedia)</p>

            <p>When I was in my early teens I read in a Girl Scout magazine, that "a robin is a thrush." The clue is the
                fledglings' speckled breasts.</p>

            <p>We are so blessed to hear the robin welcoming the dawn with its enthusiastic song. How dreary the early
                spring would be without them!</p>

            <p>Connecticut, Michigan and Wisconsin have chosen the robin as their state bird.</p>
