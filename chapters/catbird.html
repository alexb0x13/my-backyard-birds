        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>My mother loved catbirds with their mewling call. She would put out plumped raisins for them in
                Massachusetts and again here in Indiana. Her ear was better attuned to bird calls than mine ever has
                been, and she always knew when a catbird was in the area. Catbirds migrate southward for the winter and
                return to Indiana in the spring. It’s a thrill when I positively identify one in April or May. Catbirds
                have come to my clematis trellis to feed on the grapes I tie there. They otherwise feed in the leaves
                along the fencerow, keeping a low profile.</p>

            <p>As my Golden Field Guide describes, no other bird is dark gray with rusty undertail coverts. Its cap is a
                darker gray – almost black. Its legs, feet and bill are also blackish. The same source says this bird is
                a poor imitator. I disagree. I have heard the catbird sing a medley to rival that of a mockingbird;
                indeed I have often confused the two until spotting a catbird trilling away. National Geographic – Song
                and Garden Birds – comments that the catbird doesn’t repeat his notes the way a mocker does. If a
                catbird’s song is interrupted it will utter an inquisitive, “mew?” Wikipedia reports that the catbird
                mimics songs of other birds as well as those of tree frogs and even mechanical sounds. It is able to
                make two sounds at the same time! It usually sings from within a bush or small tree – out of sight – not
                like the mocker that will sing from the highest tree or post.</p>

            <p>Regarding the quality of his “mimicking,” Greg Budney of Cornell Bird Laboratory once witnessed a catbird
                in Northern California. He reports that he witnessed and taped the finest imitation of a host of species
                including: spotted towhee, rock wren, Wilson’s snipe, meadowlark, red-winged blackbird, western
                kingbird, rail, wood peewee, frogs and others. As to why the catbird performed such an incredible
                repertoire, Mr. Budney suggests that he was trying to attract a mate by demonstrating that he’s been
                around for many breeding seasons.</p>

            <p>The catbird is almost 8 inches in length. It flicks its tail frequently, which goes well with its perky,
                spunky attitude. Where a mockingbird can be aggressive – almost mean! – the catbird is assertive. He
                will respond to a distress call of another bird and will rally with other birds to harass a predator.
                The catbirds will defend their nests valiantly against predators. They also have been known to care for
                orphaned birds of another species.</p>

            <p>The male catbird arrives from its southern winter habitat during the night with the females arriving a
                few days later – similar to robins. After a few days of a vigorous courtship, the female builds a
                cup-shaped nest near the ground in thickets or tangled vines. She uses sticks, grass and leaves with
                shredded bark and tiny roots for lining. She lays three to five teal-colored eggs that hatch within
                about 12 days. As with most baby birds, the young catbird hatchlings are fed insects, and both parents
                feed the young. National Geographic reports that after the nesting season, the catbird sings a “lovely
                whisper song, much softer than the caroling of spring.”</p>

            <p>Wikipedia states that catbirds can be called close by “pishing.” This is a sound birds use when warning
                and gathering other birds to help battle a predator. I have witnessed “pishing” by a ranger at
                Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge. He called in a warbling vireo by this method.</p>

            <p>This clever bird will actually destroy cowbird eggs that are placed in their nest.</p>

            <p>Though not as flamboyant as the mockingbird, the catbird makes his presence known with its catcalls and
                occasional vocalizations. I welcome it back each spring.</p>
