        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>On a chilly April or early May day when I’ve just about given up seeing a brown thrasher, I will note
                activity in the leaves along my back property line where a chain link fence traps yard debris. It takes
                close inspection with binoculars to locate the bird responsible for the scattering leaves, as its
                coloration blends in so perfectly with its surroundings. Yes! It is a male brown thrasher. He is
                actually picking up leaves in his bill and tossing them hither and yon as he searches for insects. Some
                think he was named for this action or for the same method he uses to kill insects or lizards and tree
                frogs – thrashing them to death! It’s a challenge to spot a thrasher. You may first hear or see him
                scavenging in the leaves or thick underbrush.</p>

            <p>The thrasher is a large bird 10 to 12 inches in length, with a tail almost as long as its body. It
                measures about ten inches from top of head to tail tip. Its color is a vibrant reddish brown with a
                black streaked white breast and throat, gray around its yellow eye and a slightly down-curved black
                bill. It sports two white bars on each wing.</p>

            <p>The thrasher’s song is loud and sharp. Some report it as: drop it, drop it; cover it, cover it; pull it
                up, pull it up.” With this song, he establishes his territory and attracts a mate. The male also makes a
                loud smacking sound to alert the female of a nearby predator. Wikipedia reports thrashers will sing up
                to 3,000 distinct songs. A song will typically be repeated twice. Similar to the mockingbird, it will
                perch at some height to perform its repertoire.</p>

            <p>The three to five pale blue, brown-dotted eggs are laid in a twiggy, grass-lined nest, built in shrubbery
                or low in a tree or a thorny bush if available. Male and female thrashers both incubate and feed the
                young. During a hot, dry summer a pair brought their large fledglings to my oasis-like garden to hunt
                for bugs. It was such a thrill to see so many thrashers up closeand personal.</p>

            <p>One spring an adult thrasher came to my feeding station for suet. It gathered a generous beak full and
                then flew off over my back yard fence into the thick underbrush. These actions were repeated over and
                over. I had never before seen a thrasher eat suet. A few days later a thrasher appeared in the yard with
                a baby robin. It filled its beak with suet and fed the young robin. I did get a rather poor photo of the
                two together. It was obvious that the thrasher had raised at least one baby robin for some reason.
                Perhaps it had lost its own brood and chased the parent robins away from their nest to raise a
                substitute family. Or maybe the robin young were orphaned and the thrasher was inspired by the hungry
                cries to take over their feeding. For whatever reason, I was blessed to witness this remarkable event.
            </p>

            <p>Some sources report the thrashers eat only seeds, insects and berries. Others add acorns, lizards,
                snakes, snails and tree frogs. They will leap into the air to catch prey.</p>

            <p>This bird is common and widespread but it has declined in numbers in some areas due to loss of suitable
                habitat.</p>

            <p>The Brown Thrasher is the official state bird of Georgia and the inspiration for the name of Atlanta’s
                National Hockey League team, the Atlanta Thrashers.</p>
