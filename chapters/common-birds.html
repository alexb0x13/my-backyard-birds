        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>With very little effort, you can lure birds to your backyard. You need to provide three simple elements:
                water, food and shelter. </p>

            <p>Water - I use both elevated and ground-level birdbaths, as some birds, such as bluebirds, prefer to
                "bathe" on the ground. In droughty conditions you may see some uncommon birds, attracted by the water.
                One dry season an oriole and a scarlet tanager came to my birdbaths for a drink.</p>
            <p>Drippers are an enticement, as birds love moving water. For years I used a commercial dripper, digging a
                channel to protect the tubing from lawn mowers and curious critters, but when the underground tubing
                sprung a leak, I resorted to a "haywire rig" (a Maine expression). A simple solution is gallon plastic
                milk jug hung on a shepherd's crook with the tiniest possible pinhole in the corner overhanging the
                birdbath. If you want to pretty it up, you can either paint over the label or apply a flower graphic,
                sealed with package tape.</p>



            <figure class="cover-bird-image">
                <img src="../images/common-birds-bun.png" alt="Birds and bunny sharing the feeding area" />
                <figcaption>Birds and a rabbit peacefully sharing the feeding area</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Food – Food doesn't necessarily mean you need to put out feeders. There are many kinds of flowers, shrubs
                and trees that provide natural food. However, a feeder or two containing oil sunflower seed will also be
                appreciated by your feathered visitors. Suet feeders will attract woodpeckers, nuthatches and
                chickadees. Woodpeckers, nuthatches and other birds like commercial "nut blocks," however, when grackles
                and starlings are feeding their young, they will wipe them out in no time. Feeding birds is a rather fun
                ongoing trial and error process.</p>
            <p>Shelter – birds feel more comfortable dining at feeders placed near to some kind of shelter. I have a row
                of forsythia bushes bordering one side of my property. Because of an aging and badly trimmed maple tree
                that sheds spindly branches in windy weather, it's easy for me to build a respectable brush pile at the
                foot of the maple. To keep the less wanted birds busy, I often sprinkle mixed birdseed or cracked corn
                over the brush pile. Each December I buy a "live" Christmas tree and secure it to a post directly in
                front of my patio doors. The birds love the security of this shelter and it provides many photo ops
                especially during a snowy winter.</p>
            <p>Nesting birds are a special joy to observe. Although natural nesting is a bit out of your control, a wren
                house or bluebird house may entice those species to your yard. I must caution you that bluebirds require
                very special conditions (entrance to house should face a tree, tree shouldn't be mounted on a tree but
                on a post, etc.) but if successful, you will be rewarded by seeing these beautiful birds daily. </p>
            <p>I suspect my large bridal wreath bush "houses" cardinals and probably house sparrows among others. Birds
                love the intricate tangle of its branches, and it's perfect for cardinals as they build their nests only
                about five feet from the ground. Mourning doves nest on the curve of my downspouts and other unlikely
                places. </p>
            <p>As I have stated elsewhere, leave a bit of yard debris here and there. Last season's leaves, pine
                needles, acorns, etc. hide all kinds of goodies and it's fun to watch thrashers, towhees, many varieties
                of sparrows and others scratching and foraging for insects, spiders and lizards.</p>
            <p>In addition to birds in a "casual" yard, you will see a few animals. Rabbits, chipmunks and squirrels (a
                special curse!) inhabit my yard. A family of red foxes made a den under my friend's shed – not that you
                would wish this to happen to you! She enjoys watching the kits venture out in the evening. Animal
                Control folks assure her they will move on when the kits are older. A "commune" of cottontail rabbits
                live beneath my yard barn. I don't grow petunias in my patio boxes any more, as one year I spotted a
                bunny sitting in the box, devouring them down to stubs. I must say, though, that when they recovered,
                they were the best petunias I've ever had.</p>
            <p>Please nurture your feathered visitors and enjoy them!</p>
