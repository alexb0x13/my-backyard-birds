        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>When I was young my brother, who is five years older than I, broke out with chickenpox. I was sent to
                stay with my Aunt Esther in a nearby city so I wouldn't catch the pox. Being a voracious reader, I
                delved into the shelves of books that belonged to her stepson who no longer lived with them.</p>

            <p>Thornton Burgess, a prolific writer of animal stories, became a favorite of mine. I especially liked the
                way he gave personalities to the woodland birds and creatures, depicting their natural characteristics.
                His books were illustrated delightfully by Harrison Cady.</p>

            <p>In Animal Stories - The Three Little Bears, Sammy Jay is following Farmer Brown's boy, who is
                investigating the disappearance of maple syrup in the tapped maple tree buckets. "Silently Sammy flew
                from tree to tree behind Farmer Brown's boy. There is no noisier tongue anywhere than is Sammy Jay's
                tongue at times, but no one can be more quiet than Sammy when he is spying on others." An apt
                description of a blue jay!</p>

            <p>The jay is one of the larger and more colorful birds frequenting feeding stations year round, often
                swooping in with a flourish to scatter the other birds. It measures 9 to 12 inches crest to tail tip
                with a wingspan of 13-17 inches. Its crest reflects the bird's mood - agitation and alarm elevate the
                crest; while feeding or at rest, the crest is smooth.</p>

            <p>Its coloration is as flagrant as its actions, with a white breast and a back of lavender, shades of blue,
                and splotches of white. Its head, nape and throat are blue with black lines through the eye and a black
                "collar." One description I've read is the jay's back looks as if someone flicked a paint brush over it.
                Its bill is black and very strong, allowing it to make swift work of cracking peanuts, acorns, corn and
                other grains.</p>

            <p>I have had a lot of fun with jays. I once threaded peanuts in shell onto a length of yarn and tied it to
                a shepherd's crook. A jay tried stretching its neck down so it could get a peanut. For three days it
                tried clinging to the post and reaching a peanut that way. Finally, on the third day I saw it pull up
                the yarn, hold it in its foot, and pull it up some more until he could reach a peanut.</p>

            <p>A Jay will fly in and take all the peanuts from a feeder, one by one. Sometimes it will fly up into the
                maple tree to crack it open and eat the nuts. Other times it will fly off with one. And many times it
                will fly down to the ground with a peanut, tuck it into the grass and cover it with a couple of leaves.
                I have read that jays will devise tools to help it access food – they also hide it that way.</p>

            <p>Blue jays have gotten a bad rap being accused of eating other birds' nestlings. By methods I don't care
                to know about, only 1% of blue jays' stomachs have been found to contain evidence of this.</p>

            <p>Jays will call a warning if a hawk or other predator is in the area. My grandson one day told me he heard
                a hawk nearby. Looking around we saw only a blue jay, who was giving a good imitation of a hawk. Whether
                this was done to warn other birds of a hawk's presence or to keep other birds away from the feeders is
                anyone's guess. Its other vocalizations include the "rusty gate," a clear whistle, "yak, yak, yak," and
                a repertoire of other birds' songs to rival that of the mockingbird. I have often been intrigued with
                what I considered a "new" bird in my backyard only to find a jay trying out a new song. One Internet
                source claims jays can be taught human speech!</p>

            <p>Some years ago I started putting out peanuts for the jays. Every year a solitary jay (it seemed) would
                quietly arrive and take the peanuts away, one by one. One year when I put out peanuts in a copper
                sunflower-shaped feeder (Ref. photo), a jay would sit up in my maple tree and very noisily call what I
                assumed was its family – "YAK, YAK, YAK, YAK!"</p>

            <p>When several other Jays arrived, he would swoop in, grab a peanut and fly off. At first the younger jays
                had no idea what to do, but after watching a few times, one would fly onto the feeder and cock its head
                at the peanuts. Finally it reached in and got one in its bill. It looked around as if to say, "Okay, now
                what?" Eventually they all caught on, and when the parent jay would go into his "summoning" calls, they
                would arrive and take turns retrieving a peanut.</p>

            <p>I learned early on that I had not trained the Jays to come after peanuts; they had trained me to put them
                out. Often when I cross the street to get my newspaper or mail, I hear jays yakking at me. Some days
                without their request I'll put out a few peanuts and within seconds, it seems, a Jay will arrive to get
                them.</p>

            <p>Blue jays mate for life. They will often use another bird's nest. Both male and female build the nest and
                rear the young. The female however is the one who sits on the 4-5 white speckled eggs until they hatch –
                usually about 16-18 days, during which time the male will feed her. In about 20 days the young will
                leave the nest, and the family stays together until the fall.</p>

            <p>The blue jay, though well known and undoubtedly one of North America's most vocal and colorful birds, has
                not been selected by of the 50 states for their official state bird.</p>

            <p>Blue jays add color and animation to my backyard feeding station year round. I admire their spunk. They
                never cease to delight me with their antics.</p>
