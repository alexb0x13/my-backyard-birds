            <!-- Add your introduction content here -->
            <p>I learned birding at my parents' knees. I don't recall a time when I wasn't interested in watching birds
                and in later years photographing them. Digital cameras have enhanced and enabled nature photography as
                never before, in my opinion. My first digital Sony was a revolution to me.</p>
            <p>My first digital camera was a simple Sony with a 4X zoom lens. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven! No
                longer did I have to wait for photos to be processed to see the results of my efforts. I could focus on
                the subject with the viewfinder or with the LCD screen, take the shots and then download to the computer
                for a closer look. I might have taken 100 photos but kept only 25. What looked sharp and clear on the
                LCD screen often turned out to be slightly out of focus. Lots of disappointments, but then...a keeper!
            </p>
            <p>I upgraded to a 15X zoom Sony - when the first one wore out - that will do far more than I understand. It
                allows me get "up close and personal" with birds that visit me. I'm tempted to upgrade further...maybe
                someday.</p>
            <p>Photographing birds requires patience and vigilance. I don't even want to think about what great photo
                ops I've missed or what little dramas have been played out in my backyard when I'm not watching. And,
                unless we're in the throes of a blizzard, and I'm perched in my rocking chair in front of the patio
                doors enfolded in an afghan or two with hot chocolate by my side and camera in my hand, I don't spend a
                lot of time watching.</p>
            <p>One big tip is always know where your camera is! Keep it handy! I usually have mine on a tripod facing
                the glass patio doors. And on my drives "into town" I try to remember to take along the camera. In fact
                I recently bought another small Sony that will fit in my handbag so that I'll be sure to always have one
                with me.</p>
            <p>It's amazing what you will see on the roadside - great blue heron in a flooded section of farmland, hawks
                near open fields or rivers, an occasional bald eagle - you just never know. I was driving on Columbus
                Indiana airport property en route to a friend's house when I saw a big hawk on the side of the road
                feeding on something. It was not the least bit intimidated when I stopped the car, lowered the window
                and took several photos. I was never sure which hawk it was, but it had lovely fluffy feathered legs
                probably a young red-tailed hawk. My Mom and I years ago coming back from town on River Road near the
                Flat Rock river and Owens Bend bridge, saw what we later identified as two huge Snow Geese or Blue Geese
                in the road, honking and not the least bit afraid of us, it seemed, when I slowed the car to watch them.
                Did I have a camera with me? No!</p>
            <p>I am still a "rank amateur," but I am often pleased with my efforts.</p>
            <p>Why photograph birds? You can preserve that moment in time when you see an uncommon bird. You can prove
                to a friend, "I did so see that bird I told you about!" And you can see the finer points of a bird when
                you zoom in on your photo in the computer. You can also
                share your bird photos with friends via email or old-fashioned correspondence. My letters to relatives
                and friends who do not have e-mail are peppered with bird and "critter" photos.</p>
            <p>I once was talking on my cordless phone, roaming around the house, when I spotted in the apple tree on
                the front lawn a black-billed cuckoo. I knew what it was immediately because Mom used to see them here
                in Indiana and told me that it was one of the few birds that would eat fuzzy caterpillars. This cuckoo
                was doing just that. Tent caterpillars, locally known as “bag worms,” had taken up residence in that
                tree. I had been meaning to lop off the branches and burn or otherwise destroy the things, but I just
                hadn’t gotten around to it. So glad I didn’t! I told my friend I would have to call her back as I wanted
                to photograph a cuckoo. “A what?” she asked. “Honestly,” I said, “it’s a cuckoo. I’ll email you a photo
                later.” The black-billed cuckoo stayed a while and came back the next day. When all the caterpillars
                were eaten, it disappeared. I didn’t have to take care of the yicky things – the cuckoo did it for me.
                (See photo at end of this section.) People have asked me did I hear its sweet call? No, I didn’t. Mom
                knew the cuckoo’s song and hearing it, she'd locate it with her binoculars. (Stokes Field Guide to Birds
                gives it as “as soft repeated cucucu cucucucu.”)</p>

            <p>My goal with this book is to share my backyard birds with all who have an interest in birding and
                photography. Included is a profile of each bird and a few personal comments about my own experiences
                with it. I haven’t written about the different varieties of sparrows that delight me, the juncos (or
                “snow birds”) that arrive it seems on the first really cold day in November and leave in late spring,
                and some spring migrants that pass through each spring, such as the beautiful Rose-breasted Grosbeak,
                the female of which looks like an overweight large-billed sparrow. Nor have I included the kestrels and
                hawks that swoop in now and then to snatch a bird from the feeder area or to perch on a stump surveying
                their territory; or my favorite birds of all – the owls.</p>
            <p> The birds in this book are just a few of the varieties that I see and photograph in and around my
                backyard; they are the ones with whom I more or less have a personal relationship. They are all dear to
                my heart and give me vast pleasure.</p>
            <p>I am fortunate to live in a rural residential area bordering farmland. However, if you have even a small
                patch of lawn in an urban area, and if you are watchful, you will see a great variety of birds. I would
                suggest planting shrubs or trees that attract birds and perhaps putting out a feeder or two. Oil
                sunflower seeds are a good choice. There is an upside down suet feeder available to discourage starlings
                and blackbirds – though my recent observation (and frustration) reveal they are getting the hang of it!
                Woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, titmice and Carolina wrens have no problem clinging to the
                underside to feed on the suet.</p>
            <p> Birds are one of God’s great gifts to us. Their infinite variety, colors, behaviors and vocalizations
                provide endless opportunities for enjoyment and study. Please appreciate our feathered friends and
                protect them when you can. So many species are threatened or endangered, and so many habitats are being
                destroyed by “cleaning up” hedgerows and meadows where many birds forage for food and build their nests;
                and by cutting down mature and decaying trees that provide nesting sites for all the cavity nesters.
            </p>
            <p> My dear friend, Hellen Ochs, the “Bird Lady” of Columbus, Indiana, had a snowy owl visitor for several
                years until the surrounding acreage – the snowy’s hunting area - was taken over by buildings. It was no
                longer a feasible habitat for the snowy, and it moved on to a more suitable environment. It is a sad
                testimony to the activities enacted in the name of “progress” without regard for wildlife. </p>
