        <article class="bird-description">
            <p>I am more familiar with the habits of the house wren than those of the Carolina, as they nest in the wren
                houses I hang in my yard every spring. I try to put them out by mid-April or earlier, and it is a true
                delight to me to first hear the male's bubbly song, which soon becomes incessant to the ear. But in the
                years that they are late arriving, I feel a bit bereft.</p>

            <p>Whenever I grow tired of a bird's song, I think of Robert Frost's poem, A Minor Bird:</p>

            <div class="poem">
                <div class="poem-title">A Minor Bird</div>
                <p>I have wished a bird would fly away,<br>
                    And not sing by my house all day;</p>

                <p>Have clapped my hands at him from the door<br>
                    When it seemed as if I could bear no more.</p>

                <p>The fault must partly have been in me.<br>
                    The bird was not to blame for his key.</p>

                <p>And of course there must be something wrong<br>
                    In wanting to silence any song.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The house wren is a bit smaller than the Carolina, about five inches in length, and it is constantly in
                motion, often with tail cocked. The male will choose a nesting site, construct a nest and wait for the
                female's approval. He may build or begin to build several nests at different locations before starting
                their family at which time she will either completely rebuild the nest or, if it's to her liking, add
                soft lining materials. I believe the multiple nests are built more to confuse predators than trying to
                anticipate the whims of the female, but also it could be done to establish territory.</p>

            <p>I am never sure in which of the four or five wren houses I put out they are actually nesting. When I
                clean out the houses in the fall, I find – in all of them - sticks of almost identical length, about 1
                1/2 inches long, with feathers, moss, bark, bits of Styrofoam or other trash providing the lining. Some
                of the small wooden houses are literally packed with nesting material.</p>

            <p>Anywhere from two to eight speckled ivory eggs are incubated by the female, the male providing her
                nourishment during this time. In spite of hatching featherless in 13 days, the young become fledglings
                within 15 to 19 days. The young are fed - from my observation - from dawn to sundown and maybe longer. I
                have perched behind my camera tripod trying to capture photos of one or the other coming and going, and
                it's a challenge.</p>

            <p>From National Geographic's Song and Garden Birds: "Wrens have a strong feeding instinct and are tireless
                parents. One male, working from 4:15 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., made 1,217 trips in a single day with food for
                his family. He averaged a trip every 47 seconds, not counting the sorties that he made to satisfy his
                own hunger." It feeds on the ground and in foliage for insects. Just think, each trip represented an
                insect dispatched!</p>

            <p>The wrens' feeding instinct is so strong, "they have been seen feeding a family of grosbeaks, also a
                nestful of sparrows, which are among the wren's worst enemies."</p>

            <p>A friend has told me that when he splits firewood, wrens appear from everywhere. As fall approaches, the
                wrens seek more secluded areas, and during the fall they migrate southward.</p>

            <p>My mother, early one morning, watched parent wrens leading their fledglings, one by one, away from the
                house that was hung in a lilac tree outside the bedroom window to the nearby meadow. My parents had
                wrens nest in the yard every year for about 17 years. Eerily, when my mother slipped into Alzheimer's
                Disease they no longer came, even though I faithfully hung the same houses in the same locations. After
                her passing, I had to woo them back providing several possible nesting sites. My parents loved to hear
                the male's cheery twittering and the female's "buzzing." This is my theory that I've not seen anything
                in print to back up – that the female "chucks" at the male, and when he's in the mood, he will sing.
                I've not heard any variation from the wrens' song in this area.</p>

            <p>The house wrens have been described (Wikipedia) as "feisty and pugnacious." I would say this is true but
                perhaps an understatement! I've seen a wren pursuing a large fox squirrel, darting in to give it pecks
                on the head. It will stand up to much larger birds than itself, fiercely protecting its turf and its
                young. They are amazing little birds.</p>

            <p>It's hard to tell what will appeal to a house wren for a nesting site. I once hung a cute new wooden
                green apple wren house to no avail; instead they chose the old, wooden houses my parents used that
                required patching every year. Those houses finally fell apart, beyond repair. House wrens also showed
                preference for a birdhouse gourd with appropriate sized entry (about 1¼ inch) hung in an apple tree on
                the front lawn for years until the entrance became large enough for a sparrow and I quit using it. I
                once set a stepladder beneath the gourd and let my youngest grandson Brett watch the tiny hungry babies
                squeaking for food, their little beaks open wide, and their barely feathered wings fluttering. (See
                photos)</p>

            <p>When I visited friends and relatives in Florida, my brother made me a cute wooden birdhouse designed like
                a cat, complete with tail, bright yellow with white stripes and a red smiling mouth painted around the
                entrance. I had my doubts, but I hung it in the apple tree where the gourd used to hang. Wrens nested in
                it all summer long. It made a cute photo – a tiny wren perched next to the cat's mouth – a bit sadistic,
                maybe. Wrens also have liked a blue ceramic "bird" birdhouse that my brother and sister-in-law sent me
                for my birthday one March. I used the top of a liter soda bottle and a glue gun to convert the opening
                to a proper size for wrens.</p>

            <p>Wrens are delightful creatures to hear and to observe in their daily lives. How blessed we are to have
                them in our world!</p>
